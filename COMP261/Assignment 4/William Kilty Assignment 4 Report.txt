Comp 261
Assignment 4
William Kilty

I believe I have achieved almost all the tasks set out in the handout,
and have cross referenced with the mark sheet supplied.
Everything from stage 1 to 4 is present, except for checking nested scope.

My program parses text into a format which can be run by the robogame program.
It also prints out the parsed text into a standard format with correct indentation and spacing.

____________________________________________________________

My program performs correctly in all cases with every stage I attempted. The only time it gets finnicky is with spacing on operators
and comparitors in the challenge program. var1+var2 doesn't work as it is read as "var1+var2" instead of "var1" + "var2".
To get around this you just have to make sure you write your spacing correctly in programs. It's good practice coding anyway.
To properly fix this I'd need to change the scanner delimiter to account for all the new opperators.

____________________________________________________________

I tested my program through lots of debugging output text. Printing what the program was doing at each step of the parsing
to make sure everything it did made sense and gave back what I'd put in. Most of this debugging text was removed as it 
generally clutters up the screen. The test cases I used for stage 4 are as follows:


S4_full.txt

$Add = 1 + 15;
$Sub = 64 - 19;
$Mul = 8 * 8;
$Div = 16 / (4 + (barrelLR(numBarrels - numBarrels)));
if (1 == 1 || (true && ! false)) {
	while ((4 >= 4) && 4 > 4) {
		turnL;
	}
	move(5);
}


S4_simple.txt

$Add = 1 + 15;



In the end, I think I've sufficiently tested enough to say I'm confident there aren't any agregious bugs and I'm fairly certain
it does what it sets out to do correctly.
