I have provided a jar file for task 2 and for task 3.
To run both, you will need to load the jar file into a project in Eclipse or IntelliJ.
Additionally you will need to add all the Akka jars to the classpath.
From here you may run the main method in the cakes.java file.

If you wish to run the code across multiple machines, you may uncomment out the IP 
addresses in the main method and change them to whatever computers' IPs you wish to run on.

Task 3 contains a static final boolean FOUR_BOBS. Changing this value to true will make 
Charles utilize four instances of the Bob actor; Speeding up the process (hopefully) four times.
